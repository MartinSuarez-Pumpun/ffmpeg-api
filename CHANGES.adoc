=== 0.3

* Added EXTERNAL_PORT env variable.

=== 0.4

* Added support for custom ffmpeg parameters passed by clients.
** Clients can provide `params` as a JSON array in the request body (preferred),
   or as a multipart form field named `params` (JSON array string) when uploading files.
** Backwards-compatible `ffmpeg` query or form field is still supported.
** Parameters are applied in the following priority: `req.body.params`, `req.body.ffmpeg`,
   multipart `params`, multipart `ffmpeg`, query `ffmpeg`.
* Convert and extract routes accept custom ffmpeg args and fall back to sensible defaults when not provided.
* Output filenames now default to the original input filename (same base, new extension).
* Extracted images are prefixed with the original base name and a timestamp to avoid collisions.
* README updated with detailed curl examples and usage for custom ffmpeg parameters.


=== 0.2

* Added probe endpoint.
* Major refactoring.
